## Project overview

This project imagines the creation of a website for a fictional visitor attraction in Oxfordshire. It imagines this property - an old English country house - has recently opened to the public and the charitable trust thast runs the site wants a website for a number of purposes. They want to generate revenue by securing ticket bookings, they want to relay information to visitors about what's on offer, how to get there, and when visitors can come, and they want to generate interaction with the public. This latter will happen both directly, via a contact form, and by directing people to social media.

## UX

The main goals of the Handleigh Hall website are twofold: for its users, information; for its owners, revenue. Visitors to the site will want to know how to visit and what to expect. The owners of the site - Handleigh Hall Trust - will want to increase the revenue and publicity of the site.

## User Stories

### A user will want to:

1. Learn what Handleigh Hall is.
2. Learn when they can visit the site.
3. Learn how to get to the site.
4. Learn how to arrange a visit to the site.

## Site Owner Stories

### A site owner will want to:

5. Generate revenue through ticket sales.
6. Relay information to visitors on how to get there.
7. Generate revenue by relaying information about the food and beverage outlet on site.
8. Drive up engagement with the public via social media and direct feedback

As part of the planning for this project, I have run through the stages of User Experience Design, as proposed by [Jesse James Garrett.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_James_Garrett)

Addressing the strategy plane for this project, I asked myself who would need this website, and what they might hope to achieve by using it. I have asked these questions from the point of view of the owner and a visitor to the website. The site owner wants to generate revenue and visits by selling tickets, and making visitors aware of what's available. Visitors want to know if this place is worth visiting, and how to do so.

The Scope Plane: This plane helped to prevent the project growing beyond its immediate scope. The main strategy is to generate ticket sales by promoting the property. As such, the pages in the navigation bar are chosen to address the main questions of a visitor to these places: what is it, what food and drink is available, are there public lavatories, etc.

The Structure Plane: my wireframes can be found below. These have been constructed with the idea that mobile design should come first, and that the main aim from the point of the view of the site owner is to generate income via bookings to visit the historic house. This is why the BOOK button is visible for as much of the time as possible, and each page presents its information in a way that encourages the selling of tickets.

The Skeleton Plane: The information is structured in such a way that the pictures do much of the job of catching a user's eye, with the information kept in unobtrusive places. Navigation is performed via the header, with page title links kept clear and concise. On smaller screen sizes, where the information needs to be scrolled to, the top of the first text section is visible along with its title, telling users exactly what it is they'll find there and visually informing them how to get to it. At larger screen sizes this is different, as both the images and information can be presented at once while taking away from neither. 

The Surface Plane: Colours for the website were chosen based on those colours associated with the visual look of Handleigh Hall itself. Green for the grass around it, blue for the (optimistically) blue sky above, and the beige colour of the navigation bar to resemble the colour of the local stone from which the property was constructed.

## Existing Features

* ### Header -
    * The header, built using Bootstrap (credit and link below and in source code) allows a user to navigate easily across the pages of the site. For the site owners, this is good as ease of navigation will keep a user on the sire for longer, making them more likely to book a visit.

* ### Squashed "burger" navigation menu at smaller screen sizes -
    * Another Bootstrap addition (credit and link below and in source code), this familiar three-line icon adheres to convention by giving users something familiar they know to click for a collapsed menu.

* ### Carousel -
    * The carousel found on index.html allows the site owners to present to site users a visual teaser of the attraction, and what is available there. The first picture gives them a view of the front of the building, the second of a painting inside it, and the third of a pot of tea from the catering outlet. Having these three pictures gives the site owners three chances to hook a potential visitor, and turn their visit to the site into a booking.

* ### Contact form -
    * The contact form on findus.html allows users to submit comments and queries to the site owners by filling out and submitting the three fields. This gives users a simple point of contact for acquiring further information. It also gives the site owners the chance to interact further with site visitors, giving more opportunities to turn interactions into booking/ticket sales.

* ### Booking button -
    * The booking button found on every page except bookingform.html itself allows users to navigate to the booking form at any time once they have decided they've seen enough to interest them. This helps to secure bookings and generate revenue for the site owners. 

* ### Booking form -
    * The first page of a booking form has been built in to the bookingform.html page. This allows users to arrange to visit the site. It also allows the site owners to sell tickets online.

* ### Text boxes -
    * The boxes of text on each page allow users to learn the information they need. They also allow to site owners to provide a mix of text and images to communicate what Handleigh Hall is and answer the most commonly-sought bits of information by a visitor.

* ### Footer -
    * Conforming to convention, the footer contains some of the most basic information - social media links, the charity number, and the contact details. These last in particular are important for the user to have another means of contacting Handleigh Hall Trust other than the contact form, and also for knowing where Handleigh Hall is. Presenting the information here also allows the site owners to answer some very commonly-asked questions - namely, the address, phone number and email address - automatically.

* ### Social media links in the footer -
    * These allow a user to quickly move to other sites where they can learn more about Handleigh Hall and interact with the organisation. For the site owners, this increased interaction is another chance to turn interaction into ticket sales.

## Features left to implement

* ### Booking form payment page -
    * The booking form currently has no payment options as I have not yet learned how to do this. This would not change the form as it currently exists. Once the user has completed the first page of the booking form, they would click the "proceed to payment" button and be taken to a new form to finish the transaction.

## Template

Aspiring to simplicity, the website has been designed with a simple template that can be used across all pages. The background images have been chosen carefully (credit for these can be found below) to provide a visual indication of what's on offer at the property, and space has been left so that these remain visible on all screen sizes.

### Colours

For the site's colours, I have chosen gentle pastel colours of beige and blue. The beige is to match the colour of Cotswold stone from which the fictional building is constructed, and the blue is supposed to match the blue sky. I did not choose a directly analogous sky blue as this didn't match the beige so well, so instead a pastel blue was chosen. The background colour of the main image is a gentle green to be similar to the grass. I chose a slightly sharper shade of green than pastel green in order to contrast a little better with the pastel colours between which it would be sandwiched should the background image fail to load.

A similar beige colour to the header was chosen for the text boxes as these will scroll up over the building or sit alongside them at wider screen sizes.

### Wireframes

## Bugs

* An issue was discovered on very large screen widths with the footer bunching up to the left if the text boxes don't have enough content in them. I suspect this is something to do with the blank space I left for the background image, but I'm uncertain why it only happens at screen widths approaching 1800 pixels. As yet, this is unfixed as the amount of content I have on each page is enough to keep everything where it should be even at these larger widths and in the hypothetical situation in which this was a genuine website for a genuine property, the amount of information in those text sections would become more over time, not less.
