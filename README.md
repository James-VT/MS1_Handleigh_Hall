## UX

* This is the visitor website of the organisation looking after a historic building opened to the public as a visitor attraction.
* This website exists to provide information to visitors, and to convey information from the site owners to said visitors.
* As a visitor to the website, I want to know what's on offer, the location, and how to book tickets to visit.
* As the owner or manager of the organisation, I want to relay to customers the info that will generate revenue.
