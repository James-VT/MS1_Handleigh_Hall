## UX

As part of the planning for this project, I have run through the stages of User Experience Design, as proposed by [Jesse James Garrett.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_James_Garrett)

Addressing the strategy plane for this project, I asked myself who would need this website, and what they might hope to achieve by using it. I have asked these questions from the point of view of the owner and a visitor to the website. The site owner wants to generate revenue and visits by selling tickets, and making visitors aware of what's available. Visitors want to know if this place is worth visiting, and how to do so.

The Scope Plane: This plane helped to prevent the project growing beyond its immediate scope. The main strategy is to generate ticket sales by promoting the property. As such, the pages in the navigation bar are chosen to address the main questions of a visitor to these places: what is it, what food and drink is available, are there public lavatories, etc.

The Structure Plane: my wireframes can be found below. These have been constructed with the idea that mobile design should come first, and that the main aim from the point of the view of the site owner is to generate income via bookings to visit the historic house. This is why the BOOK button is visible for as much of the time as possible, and each page presents its information in a way that encourages the selling of tickets.

* This is the visitor website of the organisation looking after a historic building opened to the public as a visitor attraction.
* This website exists to provide information to visitors, and to convey information from the site owners to said visitors.
* As a visitor to the website, I want to know what's on offer, the location, and how to book tickets to visit.
* As the owner or manager of the organisation, I want to relay to customers the info that will generate revenue.

### Wireframes
